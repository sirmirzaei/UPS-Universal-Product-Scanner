## How It Works

### 1. Finding HTML Class Tags
Before using the extension, you need to identify the HTML class tags for products on your target website:

1. Right-click on the product element (item code/number)
2. Select "Inspect"
3. Look for the class names in the highlighted HTML
4. Copy the relevant class names (e.g., "part-info__code js-ga-product-line-number")
5. Repeat for price elements

### 2. Setting Up Tags

1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. In the "Define Tags" section:
   - Enter the item class tag in the first input field
   - Enter the price class tag in the second input field
3. Click "Save Tags"
4. Your tags are now saved for this specific website

### 3. Extracting Data

1. Navigate to the product page
2. Click the extension icon
3. Click "Extract Data"
4. Review the extracted information
5. Click "Download CSV" to export the data

## Troubleshooting Guide

### No Data Found
If you see "No products found with current tags":
1. Verify the class names are correct
2. Make sure you're on the right page
3. Check if the website's structure has changed
4. Try using different class combinations

### Incorrect Data
If the extracted data doesn't match what you see:
1. Make sure you're using the most specific class names
2. Check if there are multiple elements with the same class
3. Try using a combination of classes for more precise targeting

### CSV Export Issues
If the CSV file is empty or contains incorrect data:
1. Make sure data was successfully extracted first
2. Try extracting the data again
3. Clear the extension's saved data and restart
